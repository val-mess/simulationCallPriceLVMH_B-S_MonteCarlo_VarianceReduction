# simulationCallPriceLVMH_B-S_MonteCarlo_VarianceReduction
This project focuses on the simulation of a Call price. 
First, we estimate the historic return and volatility of the LVMH stock. Then we simulate the B&S Call price using Monte Carlo and we compare it with the explicit B&amp;S formula. Finally, we use the control variates technique to reduce the variance and obtain a 10x faster simulation. You will find 3 files :
